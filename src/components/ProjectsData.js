    description: "This project is a Spring Boot service that integrates with the Gemini 1.5 AI model to generate automated email replies. By submitting an incoming email along with a desired tone (e.g., formal, friendly, etc.), the service generates a contextually relevant response. Itâ€™s designed to be easily extendable and ideal for systems that require automated email workflows.",

    name: "Contextual Spell Checking Autocorrection using NLP",
    description: "This Python program uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) for contextual spell checking and autocorrection. It calculates the edit distance between words to determine if a word is spelled correctly. The model considers words that are 1 or 2 edit distances away from the input word and uses Bayes Theorem to compute the probability of a word being correct.",

    name: "Hate Speech Detection using Multilingual Language Model",
    description: "Hate Speech Detection is a tool that uses a multilingual language model to detect hate speech across multiple languages. The tool leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify text data, identifying segments that contain hate speech content. This solution is highly accurate, versatile, and robust, designed to handle noisy, colloquial language often found on social media or online platforms. The tool also supports multiple languages, making it suitable for global applications and provides a customizable threshold to adjust detection precision.",
